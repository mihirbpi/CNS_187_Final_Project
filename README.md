# CNS_187_Final_Project
Final project for CNS 187 at Caltech (Spring 2023)

See the writeup in the file Borkar_Mihir_Final_1.pdf
## Instructions to create figures:
Note that due to randomness you may not get the exact same figure as in the pdf writeup
- To create Fig. 1 open the notebook Borkar_Mihir_Final_1_Notebook_Figs1_3.ipynb in Colab and run it as is (make sure `size` is set to `8` and `p` is set to `0.125`)
- To create Fig. 2 open the notebook Borkar_Mihir_Final_1_Notebook_Figs1_3.ipynb in Colab, in the second cell set `size` to `16` and set `p` to `0.4`, run the notebook
- To create Fig. 3 open the notebook Borkar_Mihir_Final_1_Notebook_Figs1_3.ipynb in Colab, in the second cell change `size` back to `8` and set `p` to `0.25`, run the notebook
- To create Fig. 4 (top) open the notebook Borkar_Mihir_Final_1_Notebook_Fig4.ipynb in Colab and run it as is (make sure `n` is set to `32`), scroll to the bottom of the output of the last cell to see the feedforward connections after 4000 learning trials.
- To create Fig. 4 (bottom) open the notebook Borkar_Mihir_Final_1_Notebook_Fig4.ipynb in Colab, in the second cell change `n` from `32` to `64`, run the notebook, scroll to the bottom of the output of the last cell to see the feedforward connections after 4000 learning trials.
